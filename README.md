Code used to make graphs seen in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19184, which has formed part of my PhD.

Mainly data analysis of large data sets, applying different mathematical formulas to gain an understanding of how our simulations compare to current observables. 
As well as understanding the properties in each simulation that cause the observable quantities to differ.

All code in here was used on Sherwood Relics Simulation data (https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/astronomy/sherwood-relics/) of reionisation.
